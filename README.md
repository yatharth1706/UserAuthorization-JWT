#### What is JWT?

    JWT is abbreviated as JSON Web Token. 
    JWT is compact and URL safe means of sending claims between two parties.
    In simple language its a way of authentication between client and server. 
    It transmits information between two parties in the form
    of Json object which is very lightweight and cross platform.
    This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. 
    JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA
